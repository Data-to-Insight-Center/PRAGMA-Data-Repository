# PRAGMA-Data-Repository
PRAGMA data repository is designed for managing scientific data objects across the boundaries among different domains. 
Our data repository present a convenient and clearly-defined interface that can host both long-tail data objects or large data sets. 

PRAGMA data repository is implemented with MongoDB, which provides sharding feature that distributes the database among different machines while maintain replicas in other machines. Besides, with MongoDB as backend, we also use a single framework to store both metadata and data and offer users the possibility to decide the information they want to have as data objects metdata.
